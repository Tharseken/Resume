I’m Tharseken and I love to solve problems and find opportunities to learn. As I near the end of my undergraduate experience, completing 
a degree in Computer Engineering, I have learned to appreciate and admire the process of problem solving and critical thinking. The desire 
to learn and tackle challenging problems has allowed me to thrive in fast-paced software development environments, from start-ups such as 
TimeSaved to my most recent engineering role at Amazon. I strongly believe that my previous experience, enthusiasm, and ever-present 
aspiration to learn new concepts and technologies would compliment Facebook's rich development ecosystem and business environment, presenting 
an opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to Facebook while propelling my career growth.
